# Insight Operations (ResearchOps) Suite 🧪

Advanced statistical validation engines and intelligence repositories for technical product leaders.

### 📊 Statistical Significance in Product Discovery
I apply PhD-level rigor to usability testing. This suite features a **Significance Engine** that calculates 95% Confidence Intervals for research findings, ensuring engineering commitment is based on data, not anecdotes.

### 🛡️ Privacy-by-Design
Designed with a "Zero-Trust" data architecture. All processing is executed client-side, ensuring that sensitive research insights and PII never leave the local environment—meeting the highest standards for Government and Enterprise security.
